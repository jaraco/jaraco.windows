Status and License
------------------

``jaraco.windows`` aims to provide a pure-python interface to Windows
APIs using ctypes. This package is not designed to be exhaustive, but
rather to supply interfaces as they are needed by the contributors.

``jaraco.windows`` is written by Jason R. Coombs.  It is licensed under an
`MIT-style permissive license
<http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php>`_.

You can install it with ``easy_install jaraco.util``, or from the
`mercurial repository
<http://bitbucket.org/jaraco/jaraco.windows/get/tip.zip#egg=jaraco.windows-dev>`_ with
``easy_install jaraco.windows==dev``.

Package Contents
----------------

``jaraco.windows`` contains several modules for different purposes. For now,
read the source. Eventually, I will put high-level descriptions of the modules
here.

Installation
------------

You should install this module the normal way using setuptools or distribute.

If you want to monkeypatch the os module to include symlink compatibility, you
should add the following to your ``usercustomize`` or ``sitecustomize`` module:

	``import jaraco.windows.filesystem as fs; fs.patch_os_module()``

Thereafter, you should be able to use ``os.symlink`` and ``os.readlink`` in Windows
Vista and later using the same interface as on Unix.

Note that ``jaraco.windows.filesystem.symlink`` takes an additional optional
parameter ``target_is_directory``, which must be specified if the target is not
present and is expected to be a directory once present.

If jaraco.windows doesn't supply the interface you require for your
application, consider creating the interface and providing a patch
to the author.

  file could raise an Exception.

2.5
~~~

* Moved timers module from jaraco.util.
* Added jaraco.windows.cred with initial support for Windows Credential
  Manager.

2.4
~~~

* Added jaraco.windows.message.SendMessageTimeout.
* Fixed issue where environment changes would stall on SendMessage.

  clipboard text.
* Added support for editing environment variables in a text-editor.
* Added clipboard.get_html and clipboard.HTMLSnippet for supporting
  the HTML format from the clipboard.

1.9.1
~~~~~

* Fixed issue with clipboard handling of null-terminated strings

1.9
~~~

* Added eventlog utility
* Added support for other clipboard formats (including DIB and DIBV5), and now clipboards to proper memory locking while reading the resource
* Added registry module
* Moved office module to jaraco.office project

1.8
~~~

* Added 2to3 build support - now installs on Python 3
* Removed default import of jaraco.windows.net into jaraco.windows

1.7
~~~

* Added option to enver to remove values from a path or other semi-

* Added monkeypatch for os.symlink and os.readlink.
* Added find-symlinks command.

1.5
~~~

* NB!! Switched the order of the parameters for symlink and link to match the
  signature found in the ``os`` module. This will absolutely break any implementations
  that worked with ``jaraco.windows`` prior to 1.5.

1.4
~~~

* Added more robust support for symlink support (including a symlink traversal
  routine that works even when the target is locked). This method uses explicit
  reparse point parsing, using the new reparse module.
* Added support for hardlinks.
* Added jaraco.windows.lib for locating loaded modules.
* Added command line parameters to environ to allow override of default
  append/replace behavior.
